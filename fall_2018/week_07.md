### Last Week's Accomplishments

* Upgraded McTester to Kotlin 1.3
* Made Gradle plugin automatically add test dependency on McTester
* Created Docker images to allow easily running McTester on Jenkins and Travis
* Fixed several refmap deobufuscation bugs in Mixin
* Made McTester work with a Sponge production jar (currently on a branch)


### This Week's Plan

1. Finalize and (hopefully) merge mctester branch into SpongeForge repository
2. Create separate gradle task for running McTester tasks (instead of adding them to 'test' task)


### Anything Blocking?
