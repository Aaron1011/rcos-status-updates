### Last Week's Accomplishments

* Work on creating integrationTest sourceset and runMcTester task
* Researched JVM handling of native libraries


### This Week's Plan

1. Try loading liblwjgl once - in the actual root classloader (that JUnit creates for us)
2. Fix up strange issue with running './gradlew build runMcTester' - running './gradlew build && ./gradlew runMcTester' is fine


### Anything Blocking?
