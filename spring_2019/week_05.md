## Last Week's Accomplishments

I completed the refactoring of child spawning - all child
processes are now spawned by the waiter thread. However,
the code is not yet functional - signals are still not being received
properly.

## This Week's Plan

Debug the child spawning code, and hopefully get it functional

## Anything Blocking?
