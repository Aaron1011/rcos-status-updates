## Last Week's Accomplishments

I worked on adding timeouts to the test running threads.
I also helped a new team member get set up with the project
(installing a rust environment, installing cmake/make on WSL,
adding an SSH key to github)

## This Week's Plan

I plan to work on improving the character generation range for 
the various brute-force generators, as well as determining
if DynamoRIO execution can be sped up

## Anything Blocking?
