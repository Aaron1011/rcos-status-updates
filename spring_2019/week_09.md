## Last Week's Accomplishments

I began working on improving serialization/caching support, via using Serde.

## This Week's Plan

Continue working on caching, and fully implement serializing generator state to a file.
It should be possible to close/re-open B7, and have it continue running where it left off

## Anything Blocking?

## Notes
